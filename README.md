# Canify: Rewarding the "Made in Canada" Movement 🇨🇦

Canify boosts the Canadian economy by rewarding consumers who support the **“Made in Canada”** movement. This is particularly important when international trade policies pose challenges to our economic growth (*ahem*, USA). Users who back Canadian businesses receive **cryptocurrency rewards** and government incentives 💰.

Using **blockchain technology**, Canify provides a transparent and secure way for consumers to be recognized for their commitment to supporting local products.
