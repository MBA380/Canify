# Canify: Rewarding the "Made in Canada" Movement 🇨🇦

Canify boosts the Canadian economy by rewarding consumers who support the **“Made in Canada”** movement. This is particularly important when international trade policies pose challenges to our economic growth (*ahem*, USA). Users who back Canadian businesses receive **cryptocurrency rewards** and government incentives 💰.

Using **blockchain technology**, Canify provides a transparent and secure way for consumers to be recognized for their commitment to supporting local products.

## 🔥 What is Canify?
We developed a **Google Chrome extension** that analyzes the items in your **Amazon cart**, assessing them based on:
- ✅ Whether they are **Canadian-made**
- ✅ Whether they are **ethically sourced**

### 🎯 How Rewards Work
Users **earn NEAR coins** based on the **Canadian content** of their purchases. These coin transactions are funded through **affiliate earnings generated from Amazon**, creating a **sustainable ecosystem** that benefits both consumers and the Canadian economy 🌱.
